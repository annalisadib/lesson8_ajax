### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. Learned that an API is a set of instructions used to access a web application. Many popular sites such as Google, Twitter, Amazon, and IMDB openly release their API so that developers can create/sell products directly through their sites. This allows for a compatible application inside of an already-established website.
2. AJAX is a program used to load data on a webpage without having to refresh the page. It makes the users experience much more enjoyable and less frustrating due to constant page loads. AJAX is powered by XML/JSON, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and is used for data-driven websites as opposed to page-driven websites.
3. JSON is used to make a developer's life easier. It is an extension of JavaScript that is much easier to read and write. It is like a JavaScript shorthand. It's main purpose is transmitting data between an application and a web server.
